Paella Player
=============

The Paella (pronounce “paeja”) Player is a HTML5 video player capable of
playing multiple audio & video streams synchronously and supporting a number of
user plugins. It is specially designed for lecture recordings, like Opencast
Lectures or Polimedia pills.

By using Paella, students can view both the lecture hall and the teacher's
screen, get information about the lecture (slides, OCR, series videos,
footprints) and interact with the lecture (views, comments). Teachers can also
soft edit the lecture to set the start and end point or make breaks in the
recording.

If you want to use the Paella player, but do not use Opencast, try the
[standalone](https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella) version.
